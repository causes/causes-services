Causes Services
===============

This repository contains code to integrate Causes.com with third party services.

(This started as a fork of Github Services.  It's liberally licensed and does a thing similar to the goal of Causes Services, so we start here.)
See the [Github Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for instructions on contributing a service. -- we'll adapt this to Causes.com as time allows.
